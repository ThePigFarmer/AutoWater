# AutoWater irrigation system

Use at your own risk.

Platformio with Arduino framework.

This irrigation controller can run 4 stations. Each station can run up to 4 times a day. If you need more, the code should be easy to change (in theory). If you don't want it to run 4 times a day, set start time and stop time to 00:00.

The web frontend is as good as it is. It would be cool to have a cli for this project.

If you have any questions, you can message me (alanwedel19@gmail.com)
